Completed First deadline.
Send Email Functionality working as expected.

To send email:

1) Edit the class SendEmailViaGmail to add your email address user name and password before sending any email.
Note: this will be the sender's email address, user ID and password
2) Launch App
3) Click Compose
4) Edit each field
5) Click Send!

Please note that the same application can be used to send email via providers other than gmail by just changing the SMTP setting in the SendEmailViaGmail class.
